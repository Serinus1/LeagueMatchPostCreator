League Match Post Creator

A small application to assist in creating Lemmy/Reddit/Forum posts about a professional League game.

Currently only works for Lemmy, but has the structure available to easily add other formats.

You can start from scratch by running the application and adding leagues and teams one at a time OR

Start and close the application once to create the directory %MyDocuments%\League of Legends\Match Post Creator

You can then import data by copying files to that directory from the examples given here. (Currently only LCS)
